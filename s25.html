profession/discipline for which they are preparing. Any student who
engages in academic dishonesty or who violates the professional and
ethical standards for their profession/discipline may be subject to
academic sanctions as per the University of Utah’s Student Code: Policy
6-410: Student Academic Performance, Academic Conduct, and Professional

<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by
failure on an individual assignment, and/or failure in the course.
Academic misconduct, according to the University of Utah Student
Code:</p>
<p>“…Includes, but is not limited to, cheating, misrepresenting one’s
work, inappropriately collaborating, plagiarism, and fabrication or
falsification of information…. It also includes facilitating academic
