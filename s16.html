<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
We will use the following books for most of the lectures.  Columbia students can get free PDF copies (just search for them on <a href="https://clio.columbia.edu/">CLIO</a>).
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Proofs from THE BOOK</em> by Martin Aigner and G&#xfc;nther Ziegler</li>
<li><em>Lectures on Discrete Geometry</em> by Ji&#x159;&#xed; Matou&#x161;ek</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use the following book for one lecture.
<ul>
<li><em>Concrete Mathematics</em> by Ronald Graham, Donald Knuth, and Oren Patashnik</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>There will be one homework assignment, due on the last day of classes.
This shouldn't be a lot of work; it's just meant to give you some incentive to think
about the material in the weeks when you aren't presenting.</p>
<p>When we get to <em>Lectures on Discrete Geometry</em>, I will start posting
problems from the book each week.  Each problem has a difficulty rating
next to it.  At the end of the semester, you can turn in any set of
problems whose difficulties sum to at least 15.  Many problems have
several sub-parts; each sub-part counts separately (so you would get 5 for doing both parts of 1.2.6, for example).
I recommend doing a problem each week so that you
aren't stuck trying to do them all at the last minute.</p>
<p>You may discuss the problems with other students, but you should write up
the solutions on your own.</p>
<p>You can choose from among these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.1: 3</li>
<li>1.2: 3,5,6,8</li>
<li>1.3: 1,3,5,6</li>
<li>1.4: 2</li>
<li>4.1: 2,3,5,10</li>
<li>4.2: 1</li>
<li>4.3: 1,4</li>
<li>4.4: 1</li>
<li>6.1: 1,3,4,5,7</li>
<li>6.2: 1,4</li>
<li>7.1: 2,3,4</li>
<li>7.2: 1</li>
<li>7.3: 1,2</li>
<li>2.1: 1,3</li>
<li>2.2: 4</li>
<li>2.3: The solution to the problem in the book will be presented in class, so <a href="problems_extra.pdf">here</a> are two replacement problems.</li>
<li>5.1: 1,2,4,5,9</li>
<li>5.2: 1,2</li>
<li>5.3: 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Schedule of lectures</h2>
<p>Most weeks, there will be two lectures of about 50 minutes each.  There will be a few weeks when we have three slightly shorter lectures.</p>
