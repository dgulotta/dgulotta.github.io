<h1>Undergraduate Seminar (Fall 2015): Elliptic Curves</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Organizer</dt><dd>Daniel Gulotta</dd>
<dt>Email</dt><dd>dgulotta .at. math.columbia.edu</dd>
<dt>Prerequisites</dt>
<dd>Experience with proofs and elementary number theory is recommended.</dd>
<dt>Location and time</dt>
<dd>Monday and Wednesday 4:10-5:10 PM in 622 Math.</dd>
<dt>Office Hours</dt>
<dd>I will be in the help room (406 Math) on Mondays from 1-2pm, Tuesdays from 3-4pm, and Fridays from 12-1pm.  Let me know if you want to meet at some other time.</dd>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>The main reference for the couse will be:</p>
<ul><li><em>Rational Points on Elliptic Curves</em> by Joseph Silverman and John Tate.<br/>Columbia students can get a free PDF copy and reduced price softcover copy <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio11318787">here</a>.</li></ul>
<p>The following reference isn't required, but you may want to take a look at it to get a different perspective on the material.</p>
<ul><li><em>Elliptic Curves: Number Theory and Cryptography</em> by Lawrence Washington.<br/>Columbia students can get a free PDF copy <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio7936404">here</a>. (The PDF of chapter 2 is unreadable in some places, but the other chapters seem to be okay.)</li></ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Each student will give two 50-minute lectures and write a paper
(approximately 10 pages) on a topic related to the course.  A third lecture is optional.</p>
<p>The goal of the paper assignment is to learn something new about a topic
related to the class, and then write an article to introducing the topic
to other undergraduate mathematics majors.
<a href="papertopics.pdf">Here</a> is a list of suggested topics for the
paper.  If you want some ideas on how to structure your paper, you can look at some examples <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-104-seminar-in-analysis-applications-to-number-theory-fall-2006/projects/">here</a>, or ask me.  The first draft will be due before Thanksgiving break, and the final
version will be due on the last day of classes.</p>
<p>I recommend that you use LaTeX to typeset your paper.  A good reference for LaTeX is <a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e</a>.  <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org">Detexify</a> is useful for looking up LaTeX symbols.</p>
<p>Some useful mathematical writing resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/18.704/www/piiUJM2.pdf"><em>Writing a Phase Two Math Paper</em></a> by Steven Kleiman.  The first page and a half refers to an old MIT writing requirement, but the rest is still useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf"><em>Mathematical Writing</em></a> by Donald Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul Roberts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Schedule of talks</h2>
<p>All references are to Silverman and Tate unless otherwise noted.  [IR] refers to <em>A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory</em> by Ireland and Rosen.</p>
